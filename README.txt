#Summary
This is an introduction to my audio narrative assignment. It primarily tells the story of Leicester City Football Club’s journey to winning the Premier League title in the 2015-16 season. The narrative will start from the end of the previous season leading up to their triumph, covering the background of the players and the team. The main focus will be on the events of the 2015-16 season, the subsequent development of the team and players, and the spirit of perseverance and determination. The story will be complemented by live sound effects, documentary materials, and music to create an immersive experience for the audience.
